To see a world in a grain of sand   
And a heaven in a wild flower      
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand  
And eternity in an hour                              
If you were a teardropIn my eye  
For fear of losing youI would never cry  
And if the golden sunShould cease to shine its light  
Just one smile from youWould make my whole world bright
Never give up  
Never lose hope  
Always have faith  
It allows you to cope  
Trying times will pass  
As they always do  
Just have patience  
Your dreams will come true  
So put on a smile  
You'll live through your pain  
Know it will pass  
And strength you will gain  
Hold fast to dreams 
For if dreams die 
Life is a broken-winged bird 
That can never fly   
Hold fast to dreams  
For when dreams go  
Life is a barren field  
Frozen only with snow 
If I could save time in a bottle 
the first thing that I'd like to do 
is to save every day until eternity passes away 
just to spend them with you 
If I could make days last forever 
if words could make wishes come true 
I'd save every day like a treasure and then 
again I would spend them with you 

Rain is falling all around
It falls on field and tree 
It rains on the umbrella here
And on the ships at sea

What does the bee do
Bring home honey
And what does Father do
Bring home money
And what does Mother do
Lay out the money
And what does baby do
Eat up the honey

O sailor come ashore
What have you brought for me
Red coral  white coral
Coral from the sea

I did not dig it from the ground 
Nor pluck it from a tree
Feeble insects made it 
In the stormy sea

Who has seen the wind
Neither I nor you
But when the leaves hang trembling
The wind is passing through 

Who has seen the wind
Neither you nor I 
But when the trees bow down their heads
The wind is passing by

O wind  why do you never rest 
Wandering whistling to and fro 
Bring rain out of the west  
From the dim north bringing snow

In April 
Come he will 
In May 
Sing all day 
In June  
Change his tune  
In July 
Prepare to fly  
In August 
Go he must 
 
When I was down beside the sea 
A wooden spade they gave to me  
To dig the sandy shore 

The holes were empty like a cup  
In every hole the sea camp up 
Till it could come no more 
Boats sail on the rivers 
And ships sail on the seas  
But clouds that sail across the sky  
Are prettier far than these  

There are bridges on the rivers  
As pretty as you please  
But the bow that bridges heaven  
And overtops the trees 
And builds a road from earth to sky
Is prettier far than these  

How do you like to go up in a swing
Up in the air so blue 
Oh I do think it the pleasantest thing
Ever a child can do  
 
Up in the air and over the wall 
Till I can see so wide 
River and trees and cattle and all  
Over the countryside 

Till I look down on the garden green 
Down on the roof so brown 
Up in the air I go flying again  
Up in the air and down£¡

What is pink A rose is pink 
By the fountain's brink 
What is red A poppy's red  
In its barley bed 
What is blue The sky is blue 
Where the clouds float thro
What is white A swan is white 
Sailing in the light  
What is yellow Pears are yellow
Rich and ripe and mellow
What is green The grass is green
With small flowers between
What is violet Clouds are violet  
In the summer twilight  
What is orange Why an orange  
Just an orange  

A house of cards 
Is neat and small 
Shake the table 
It must fall
Find the court cards 
One by one 
Raise it roof it 
Now it's done 
Shake the table 
That's the fun
What does little birdie say 
In her nest at peep of day 
Let me fly says little birdie  
Mother let me fly away
Birdie rest a little longer 
Till the little wings are stronger 
So she rests a little longer 
Then she flies away 
 
What does little baby say 
In her bed at peep of day  
Baby says like little birdie 
Let me rise and fly away 
Baby sleep a little longer  
Till the little limbs are stronger 
If she sleeps a little longer 
Baby too shall fly away 

Twinkle twinkle little star 
How I wonder what you are 
Up above the world so high  
Like a diamond in the sky
When the blazing sun is gone 
When he nothing shines upon 
Then you show your little light 
Twinkle twinkle all the night 

The dark blue sky you keep 
And often thro' my curtains peep  
For you never shut your eye 
Till the sun is in the sky 

'Tis your bright and tiny spark 
Lights the traveler in the dark
Though I know not what you are 
Twinkle twinkle little star

 Practice while others are complaining
 Believe while others are doubting
 Plan while others are playing
 Study while others are sleeping
 Decide while others are delaying
 Prepare while others are daydreaming
 Begin while others are procrastinating
 Work while others are waiting
 Save while others are wasting
 Listen while others are talking
 Smile while others are frowning
 Compliment while others are criticizing
 Persist while others are quitting
 Progress while others are lagging behind
 Then you will succeed while others are failing
